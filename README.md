# Welcome to my Github!

## About Me:

I am a Software Developer and Massage Therapist! A full stack developer that is looking to improve, keep learning, and help those along the way! I have two cats named Haru and Krissy, my greatest weakness is the ability to not spoil them.

Some goals I have set for 2022 is to learn more testing, debugging, and use my skills to create a baking website that I can show friends and family! I eventually want to be on a team to help develop AR/VR to redesign the educational system!
